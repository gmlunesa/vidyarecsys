In this stage, I preprocessed my data ready for further operations.
- The list of all Steam apps was retrieved from the Steam API [link](api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v0002/?format=json), saved as `applist.json`.
- The genres for each _existing_ Steam app were also retrieved, then saved as `applist_genre.json`. This was done by `applistparser.py`, by sending queries through this [API link](http://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=XX) with every App ID.
- A matrix representation, to represent the games the user owns within each category (determined as Action, Strategy, RPG, Indie, Adventure, Sports, Simulation, MMO, Free and Casual), was then generated by `generatematrix.py`, with the output saved as `matrix.csv`. Compressed version was stored in this repository due to file size constraints.
- Next, the metadata of the games which will be used for machine learning is then generated through `generatemetadata.py`, with the output saved as `metadata.csv`.
