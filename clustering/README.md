In this stage, clustering the users was conducted to be able to know their preferences, using the genre matrix generated.
-   The elbow curve technique was employed to get the optimum amount of clusters. Seven clusters were determined. Code and graphs are contained in `elbowcurve.ipynb`.
-   K-means clustering was conducted, each of the users' cluster classification was appended in the output file `out.csv`. Function definitions are contained in `kmeans.py` while graphs could be seen in `kmeans.ipynb`.
