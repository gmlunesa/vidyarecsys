For data gathering, I used the [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) provided by Valve, Steam's developer. I obtained [API keys](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) from myself and eight other people.

Originally I conducted the data queries with NodeJS, but switched to Python eventually.
